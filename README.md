# EcomApp - Big Data Project
Designing Standalone E-commerce Website over Cloud (Azure Web Services) using Scalable Distributed Architecture

This repository code for ecommerce site in Node.js.

Description of the project: 
Designed, configured, implemented and deployed a complete bare bone E-commerce solution over a distributed big data environment. All resources used were incorporated using Azure Web Services and other open source tools. The final site would allow customers to access, search and view product related data stored on a scalable architecture with future possibilities for shopping cart implementation and customer login.

• Implemented non-blocking Node.js as the primary engine behind the application deployment
• Used Express Framework and bootstrap over jade for front end development
• Cached content using standard tier REDIS as a service on Azure Web Services
• Utilized document-oriented MongoDB with RoboMongo for storing product data with seamless connection using Monk driver
• Static content hosted over Akamai Content Delivery Network on Azure
• Textual data indexed on Microsoft Azure Search with Lucene search features
• Hosted the entire site on cloud as an Azure app service using continued deployment via Microsoft Visual Basic
